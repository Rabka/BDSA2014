\begin{itemize}
%---------------------------------------------------------
\item \textit{Usability}
%---------------------------------------------------------
To integrate CALENDAR in the users daily activities, the interface and functionality have to be kept simple and intuitive. This design goal is a refinement of the nonfunctional requirement “Usability”.
%---------------------------------------------------------
\item \textit{High availability}
%---------------------------------------------------------
For better user interaction it should be possible for the clients to access our system form as many places and as often as possible.
%---------------------------------------------------------
\item \textit{High Reliability}
%---------------------------------------------------------
No potential issues may accur during dayly usage that would make it impossible to do a use case. This design goal is a refinement of the nonfunctional requirement “Reliability”.
%---------------------------------------------------------
\item \textit{Stable response time}
%---------------------------------------------------------
The system' "response time" may not increase with increasing numbers of users or events, Therefsore the CALENDAR should support a growing user base. Performance should be as close to constant  as possible. This design goal is a refinement of the nonfunctional requirement “Performance”.
%---------------------------------------------------------
\item \textit{High extensibility}
%---------------------------------------------------------
It should be possible to extend key sectors of the system. Thus a feature in addition to notifications should be addable without having
to alter the code nessesary for the notification task etc. to work. This design goal is a refinement of the nonfunctional requirement “Supportability”.
%---------------------------------------------------------
\item \textit{High portability}
%---------------------------------------------------------
To maximize the availability of CALENDAR it has to be availablee on as many of the users platforms as possible. This design goal is a refinement of the nonfunctional requirement “Implementation”.
