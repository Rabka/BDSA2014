	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Identify all relevant \textbf{Actors}.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[1)]Client
			\item[2)]Server
			\item[3)]Moderater

	Praticipating actor	&&Claus, Jan: Client \\

	\hline
	Flow of events	&1)&Claus' birthday is coming up, so he needs to invite any participants\\ 
					&&who would like to come. therefore he makes an event in the CALENDAR.\\
				&2)&When Claus have opened his CALENDAR, he uses the ''New event'' function. which\\ 
					&&opens a new window for specifying the new event. \\
				&3)&He enters the date, place and a short discription of the event.\\
					&&Claus also choses a color for the event. A time he like to be alermed\\
					&&of the event and then he confirms his input.\\
				&4)&The CALENDAR closes the spicification window and shows Claus CALENDAR with\\
					&&his new event. Claus then uses the ''Share'' function and gets a digital code\\
					&&he copyes and pasts it on hes Facebook wall.\\
				&5)&The friend Jan notices this digital code and wishes to take part in Claus' \\ 
					&&birthday. He therefore uses the digital code to get to a window, where he can\\
					&&chose to accept, which will put the event in his CALENDAR.\\
				&6)&Jan and Claus can now see the event in their calendar, with date, place,\\
					&&description and how many participants that have accepted the event.\\

	Scenario name	&&Upcomming event notification\\

	Praticipating actor	&&Claus: Client \\
	instances       	&&server: Server\\
	\hline
	Flow of events	&1)&A week ago Claus inserted an event to his CALENDAR where he added\\ 
					&&an ''event alert'' to notify him 2 hours before the event.\\
				&2)&The server reacts to the ''event alert'' at the spicified time, by sending\\
					&&a message to the client Claus with the details for the upcomming event.\\
				&3)&Claus now gets a message notification in the form of an email etc.\\ 
				&4)&The message tells him of the upcomming event and shows him his CALENDAR\\
					&&for today.\\

\begin{tabular}{l r @{} l}
	\textbf{Participating objects for the enable alert use case.}\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Server:} Server activity which regularly checks up on all events and \\
	notifies users in case of an upcoming event. It is up to the user if he wants to have a notification sent,\\ 
	so the server will participate in the user’ events and choice of enabling the notification alert.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{User} the user can create events in his calendar. As such he is the initiator of event creation and \\
	other users may participate in those events if they are shared. \\
	Additionally a new possible event alert may be initiated which the server will participate in.\\
	\hline

\begin{enumerate}
		\item[7.] Identify \textbf{Non-functional Requirements} and document them i a table\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tabular}{l r @{} l}
	\textbf{Non-functional Requirements}\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Usability:} Users must be able to view (not edit) a shared event without having an account\\
	 thus without logging in. The user interface should be kept simple, so fancy features should be kept\\
	 at a minimum. The only exception to the latter is if more features are kept isolated\\ 
	 from the simple interface, meaning that there may be a page dedicated for advanced features.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Reliability:} The system may not make changes to the database in a way where a failure\\
	 could corrupt the database. For instance, a script may not make multiple statements that depend\\
	 on each other and send them to the server individually, only collectively.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Performance:} The asymptotic running time of the program must not increase propositionally\\
	by the number of events.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Supportability:} The system must be designed in a way, so that new notifications types besides\\
	upcoming events notification can be implemented without the need to alter the implementation\\
	of the upcoming event notification.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Implementation:} The implementation must work on\\
	at least one of the following main platform: Windows or Mac OS.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Operation:} moderator maintains the users, but should be kept from seeing as much personal\\
	 information from users as possible unless specifically requested by the moderator.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Legal:}  As in accordance to the Danish law \S 264,\\
	 it is not legal to forward messages or pictures concerning another person’ private circumstances\\
	 or pictures without permission from the person in question.\\ 
	This also means that the calendar system must not publicize/distribute the user’ events\\
	 or personal information (ads for software etc.) without the user’ personal permission.\\
	\hline
